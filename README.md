## Introduction

This add-on will automatically load SQL-like files into the DDEV database container when starting a project with no database initialized. See [offical Queues documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues) for more details.

This can be used to:

- configure the database service
- add additional databases
- populate the database

In addition, this makes it easy to

- reset the database service using `ddev export` and `ddev delete`
- configure the database of a cloud service such as Gitpod

## Getting Started

This add-on requires DDEV v1.19.3 or higher.

- Install the DDEV db-init add-on:

```shell
ddev get tyler36/ddev-db-init
ddev restart
```

## What does this add-on do and add?

1. Checks to make sure the DDEV version is adequate.
2. Adds `.ddev/docker-compose.db-init.yaml`, which mounts a ddev folder into the database container.

## Guides

## Reset the DDEV database service

- Create a backup of the current database.

```shell
ddev export-db --gzip=false -f db.sql
```

- Move the file into `.ddev/db-init`.

```shell
mv db.sql ./.ddev/db-init
```

- Destroy the DDEV database (you created a backup, didn't you?).

```shell
ddev delete -Oy
```

- Recreate the DDEV services.

```shell
ddev start
```
